<h4>
    The presented work is an example of the SVC library from the Sklearn package, use to perform different Machine Learning techniques, in this case: Support Vector Machine Algorithm.
</h4>
<br>
<p>
    The data is multi-labeled, but for the purposes of the model, is going to be encoded to make it a binary classification problem. The data is unbalanced, so F1-Score for evaluation would be used as primary metrics along with the corresponding confussion matrix. The data is highly dimentional, and for the purposes of the analysis a Principal Component Analysis would be fitted for the data.
</p>
<p>
    The language used to perform the analysis and create the model is Python. And the libraries used for the task are:
    <ul>
        <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for plot the data </li>
        <li>Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation</li>
        <li>Sklearn to train the model and measure the F1-Score</li>
        <li>Mlxtend for plot the boundary limits</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h5>About the data:</h5>
<p>
    The dataset consists of laboratory measurements with 615 entries and 12 parameters plus a class label. The units of the data are mostly in g/L. The parameter are:
    <ul>
       <li>Category: Nominal value, indicates the status of the patient</li>
       <li>Age: Numerical discrete value</li>
       <li>Sex: Categorical value (m for male and f for female)</li>
       <li>ALB: Albumin (Most important protein in the body; transport and liquid pressure function)</li>
       <li>ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase (Enzime of the bones and liver, increases in inflamatory diseases)</li>
       <li>ALT: Alanine aminotransferase (Functional enzyme of the liver)</li>
       <li>AST: Aspartate aminotransferase: (Functional enzyme of the liver)</li>
       <li>BIL: Bilirrubin (Indicates liver disease associated with the gallbladder)</li>
       <li>CHE: Cholinesterase (Hepatic enzyme)</li>
       <li>CHOL: Cholesterol (Energetic and structure biomolecule free in blood)</li>
       <li>CREA: Creatinine (Mostly a biomarker of renal disease)</li>
       <li>GGT: Gamma-glutamyl transferase (Another enzime that indicates liver function and gallblader diseases)</li>
       <li>PROT: Total proteins in serum</li>   
    </ul>

SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.<a class="link-info" href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/spss-modeler/SaaS?topic=models-how-svm-works" target="_blank">[1]</a>
